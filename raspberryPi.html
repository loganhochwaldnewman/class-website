<h1>This $50 pocket computer is small enough to fit in your hand but advanced enough to function like a computer.</h1>
<h1>In our class we have the Raspberry Pi 5 (the most recently engineered of the Raspberry Pi’s)</h1>
<h1>This plug-and-play computer isn’t much larger than a credit card and fits easily in your pocket, so you could actually take it with you anywhere you go. All you need to do is plug the device into any monitor or television, as it doesn’t come with its own screen, and you’re ready to go.
    But what can you do with a Raspberry Pi? In short: Many of the activities you enjoy when using a regular computer, and then some. You can do everything from managing LED displays to creating a weather station to using your Raspberry Pi as a low-cost web server to home automation projects.</h1>
